# Getting Started with Hugo and Blowfish

I recently decided to rebuild my personal website using Hugo, a fast static site generator written in Go. After exploring various themes, I settled on Blowfish for its clean design and extensive customization options.

## Why Hugo?

Hugo offers several advantages:

- **Speed**: Lightning-fast build times
- **Flexibility**: Powerful templating system
- **Simplicity**: Easy content management with Markdown
- **Performance**: Static sites are incredibly fast

## Setting Up Blowfish

The Blowfish theme provides excellent documentation and a variety of layout options. I particularly appreciate:

1. **Multiple homepage layouts**
2. **Built-in dark mode support**
3. **Comprehensive configuration options**
4. **Beautiful typography**

## Custom Styling

One of the first things I wanted to customize was the logo. I created a custom text logo with an animated gradient effect that cycles through blue, purple, and cyan colors.

The implementation involved:
- Adding custom CSS to `assets/css/custom.css`
- Creating a custom header partial
- Configuring the theme parameters

## What's Next?

I'm excited to continue building out this site with more content and possibly some interactive features. Stay tuned for more posts about web development, technology, and my various projects!
