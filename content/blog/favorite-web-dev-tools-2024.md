# My Favorite Web Development Tools in 2024

As a web developer, having the right tools can make all the difference in productivity and code quality. Here are my current favorites that I use daily.

## Code Editors & IDEs

### VS Code
Still my go-to editor for most projects. The extension ecosystem is unmatched, and the performance keeps getting better.

**Must-have extensions:**
- Prettier for code formatting
- ESLint for JavaScript linting
- GitLens for enhanced Git integration
- Auto Rename Tag for HTML/JSX

### Neovim
For quick edits and when working on remote servers, Neovim with a good configuration is incredibly efficient.

## Terminal & Command Line

### Warp Terminal
A modern terminal with AI assistance that's been a game-changer for my workflow. The AI can help with complex commands and debugging.

### Oh My Zsh
Makes the terminal experience much more pleasant with themes, plugins, and useful shortcuts.

## Development Environment

### Docker
Essential for consistent development environments across different machines and team members.

### Node Version Manager (nvm)
Switching between Node.js versions for different projects is seamless with nvm.

## Design & Prototyping

### Figma
The collaborative features make it perfect for working with designers and stakeholders.

### Tailwind CSS
Utility-first CSS framework that speeds up styling significantly.

## What's in Your Toolkit?

These tools have significantly improved my development workflow. What are your favorite tools? I'm always looking for new recommendations!
